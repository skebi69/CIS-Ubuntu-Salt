# 1.4.2 Ensure bootloader password is set
# # Description:
# Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter
# a password before being able to set command line boot parameters
# Rationale:
# Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized
# user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users
# from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time).
