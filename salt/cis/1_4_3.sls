# 1.4.3 Ensure authentication required for single user mode
# Description:
# Single user mode (rescue mode) is used for recovery when the system detects an issue
# during boot or by manual selection from the bootloader.
# Rationale:
# Requiring authentication in single user mode (rescue mode) prevents an unauthorized user
# from rebooting the system into single user to gain root privileges without credentials.
