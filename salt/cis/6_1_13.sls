# 6.1.13 Audit SUID executables
# Description:
# The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's
# permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the
# group. The most common reason for a SUID program is to enable users to perform
# functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.

# Rationale:
# There are valid reasons for SUID programs, but it is important to identify and review such
# programs to ensure they are legitimate.
