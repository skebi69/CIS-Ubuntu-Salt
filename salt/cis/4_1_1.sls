# 4.1 Configure System Accounting
# System auditing, through auditd , allows system administrators to monitor their systems
# such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd
# will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication
# events. Events will be logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log . The recording of these events
# will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are
# captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated.
# The recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces large
# quantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or process
# these logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and Workstations. Note:
# For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64
# bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.
