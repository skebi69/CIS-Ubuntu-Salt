# 6.1.11 Ensure no unowned files or directories exist

# Description:
# Sometimes when administrators delete users from the password file they neglect to
# remove all files owned by those users from the system.
# Rationale:
# A new user who is assigned the deleted user's user ID or group ID may then end up
# "owning" these files, and thus have more access on the system than was intended.
