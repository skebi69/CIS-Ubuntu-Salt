#  1.1.21 Disable Automounting
# Description:
# autofs allows automatic mounting of devices, typically including CD/DVDs and USB drives.
# Rationale:
# With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc
# and have its contents available in system even if they lacked permissions to mount it
# themselves.

{% set rule = '(1.1.21)' %}

{% else %}

{{ rule }} disable automounting:
