# 1.1.20 Ensure sticky bit is set on all world-writable directories
# Description:
# Setting the sticky bit on world writable directories prevents users from deleting or
# renaming files in that directory that are not owned by them.
# Rationale:
# This feature prevents the ability to delete or rename files in world writable directories
# (such as /tmp ) that are owned by another user.
