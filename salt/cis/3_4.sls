# 3.4 TCP Wrappers

# 3.4.1 Ensure TCP Wrappers is installed
# Description:
# TCP Wrappers provides a simple access list and standardized logging method for services
# capable of supporting it. In the past, services that were called from inetd and xinetd
# supported the use of tcp wrappers. As inetd and xinetd have been falling in disuse, any
# service that can support tcp wrappers will have the libwrap.so library attached to it.
# Rationale:
# TCP Wrappers provide a good simple access list mechanism to services that may not have
# that support built in. It is recommended that all services that can support TCP Wrappers,

# It is critical to ensure that the /etc/hosts.deny file is protected from unauthorized write
# access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either
# inadvertently or through malicious actions.
